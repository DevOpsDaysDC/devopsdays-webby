<p>
  DevOpsDays Boston 2016 is currently accepting session, tutorial, and lightning talk proposals from interested speakers. Our programming is focused on three goals:

  <dl>
    <dt>Diverse backgrounds</dt>
    <dd>We're eager to provide a platform to our speakers, so if devops hasn't
    included people like you in the past, tell us about it in your proposal. We
    want to make a space for the perspectives of people that are underrepresented
    in or excluded from technology: people of color, women, LGBTQ people, people
    with disabilities, students, veterans, and many more. In the more specific
    context of this event, we want to hear about devops from a wide set of roles:
    QA testers, security teams, DBAs, network administrators, compliance experts,
    UX designers, government employees, scientists, and other technologists who
    face unique challenges.</dd>

    <dt>New ideas</dt>
    <dd>Sure, we know that Docker's hot right now - but what's going to be hot
    next year? What about in five years? Present the right idea at the right
    time, and you could help shape that! To help keep our content fresh,
    preference will also be given to talks that have never been presented at a
    conference, or even better, to speakers who aren’t regulars on the
    “conference circuit”.</dd>

    <dt>Healthy discussion</dt>
    <dd>Most session submissions focus on how to use a specific piece of
    technology - and most of those are not accepted. The most memorable
    conference talks question assumptions, make predictions, or draw conclusions.
    It's even okay to (respectfully) tell someone that they're wrong - we'd much
    rather have a disagreement than a room full of nodding heads! DevOpsDays are
    centered around open spaces, and a good session should act like fertilizer
    for them, giving people something to start talking about.</dd>
  </dl>

    We’re also <span class="strong">very interested in nominations</span>. Did
    you see an awesome presentation at another conference? Is one of your friends
    hoping to break into the conference circuit? Let us know who to reach out to,
    or send an introductory email yourself!
</p>

<h4>Programming guidelines</h4>
<p>
  In 2016, we are actively soliciting programming that addresses these topics:
  <ul>
    <li>Software development practices for the devops world</li>
    <li>Velocity, sustainability, and technical debt</li>
    <li>Quantifying productivity, failure, and risk metrics</li>
    <li>Professional development, teaching, training, and mentorships</li>
    <li>Emotional labor and empathy</li>
    <li>Teaching junior engineers how to be senior engineers</li>
    <li>Mental health, stress, and burnout</li>
    <li>Learning lessons from other fields (manufacturing, military, etc.)</li>
  </ul>
<p>

<p>
  We will also accept submissions on perennially popular topics from previous DevOpsDays:
  <ul>
    <li>Continuous deployment</li>
    <li>Automation</li>
    <li>Containerization</li>
    <li>Performance monitoring</li>
    <li>Configuration management</li>
    <li>Devops in the enterprise</li>
    <li>Microservices</li>
    <li>Development methodology</li>
    <li>Scaling out devops</li>
    <li>Hiring for devops</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  However, please consider that novelty is heavily encouraged as per our
  guidelines above. These topics are popular, but every year we receive more
  submissions about them than we can accept.
</p>

<p>
  Once you know what you want to talk about, think about the format you'd
  prefer to do it in:
  <dl>
    <dt>Sessions</dt>
    <dd>20 to 45 minute presentations (recommended: leave 5 minutes for
    questions). Sessions usually feature either a speaker or a moderated
    panel.</dd>

    <dt>Lightning talks or ignite talks</dt>
    <dd>Fast-paced, 5 minute presentations (no questions!) given rapid-fire in
    a scheduled time slot, right before the evening social.</dd>

    <dt>Tutorials or workshops</dt>
    <dd>One hour to four hour slots focused on improving skill mastery.
    Tutorials typically include a mix of presentation content and a hands-on
    “lab”, often with code samples or collaborative coding. This format is
    significantly more work than a session, and is not recommended for
    first-time presenters.</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<h4>Submitting a talk</h4>
<p>
  Send an email to <a href="mailto:<%= render(:partial => "/#{@eventhome}/_email_organizers") %>?subject=Talk Submission <%= @eventid %>"><%= render(:partial => "/#{@eventhome}/_email_organizers") %></a> with the following information:
  <ol>
    <li>Title: we'll help you with this if you want!</li>
    <li>Format: session, panel, poetry slam, etc.</li>
    <li>Time slot: session, lightning, or tutorial</li>
    <li>Description: 500 words or less</li>
    <li>Personal info: who you are, why you want to speak, where you work, how
    you heard about DevOpsDays, etc.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  <span class="strong">Please keep these guidelines in mind:</span>
  <dl>
    <dt class="em">Absolutely no vendor pitches</dt>
    <dd>If your talk is only interesting to someone paying money for your
    product, it’s a bad fit for DevOpsDays.</dd>

    <dt>Follow the code of conduct</dt>
    <dd>For example: no threats, no sexualized language or imagery, no insulting
    audience members</dd>

    <dt>Explain why your proposal is interesting to the devops community</dt>
    <dd>We’d rather have a lackluster abstract about a very interesting topic
    than a detailed outline of a topic that isn’t a good fit.</dd>

    <dt>Your talk will go through a blind review process</dt>
    <dd>That means that reviewers will receive a version of your talk edited to
    obscure all names, companies, and so on. Make sure that your proposal still
    makes sense without this information.</dd>

    <dt>Avoid purely technical talks</dt>
    <dd>We all love technology, but this isn’t a programming language
    conference or a Docker conference. Talk about tools in the context in which
    they’ll be used, and relate them to the problems that they solve.</dd>

    <dt>Multiple proposals won’t all be accepted</dt>
    <dd>If you send in five proposals, we’ll accept the one that is the best
    fit for the conference. It’s very rare that any speaker will speak more
    than once, because that would lead to very homogenous programming.</dd>
  </dl>
</p>

<h4>What to expect</h4>
<p>
  Shortly after you send in your proposal, we'll reach out to you to confirm
  acceptance. We'll provide feedback on your proposal and let you know whether
  it's ready for review, needs work first, or is not going to be a good fit for
  the event. When we're on the same page about the proposal, we'll put in the
  review queue.
</p>

<p>
  Until the submission deadline, you'll continue to have the opportunity to
  revise your proposal if desired. The submission deadline closes on
  <%= @cfp_close %> and within two weeks (about two months before the event),
  we'll let you know whether your proposal was accepted.
</p>

<p>
  If your proposal is accepted, we strongly encourage you to send us your final
  presentation materials as soon as possible so that we can provide editing and
  feedback. This applies to everyone, but especially to new speakers and
  lightning talk or tutorial presenters (as these are challenging formats). We're
  also more than happy to help you do a test run of your talk over Skype.
</p>

<p>
  In the months before the event, you'll need to coordinate with us if you
  require accommodations for travel, hotel, medical needs, childcare, or anything
  else that would affect your ability or willingness to attend. (If you are
  curious about whether we could cover your particular situation, please reach
  out in advance.)
</p>

<p>
  We strongly encourage speakers to attend both days of the conference so you
  can spread your ideas in the conference open spaces. Note that the Evening
  Social has typically been on the first evening of the conference, and the
  Speaker’s Dinner has typically been on the last evening of the conference. we
  recommend planning your travel to permit attending both of these events, as
  they’re a great chance to meet attendees who are excited by your talk!
</p>

<p>
  When you do arrive, check in with a DevOpsDays volunteer and let them know
  you're a speaker. They'll introduce you to our staff, get you a speaker
  badge, and schedule some time for an AV test. We recommend assuming the worst
  and having your presentation materials accessible in a way that organizers
  can help you if something breaks, such as sharing it via Google Drive.
</p>

<p>
  In 2016, we plan to be a multi-track conference. The front row of each room
  will be reserved for speakers. Please try to attend the session previous to
  yours in order to minimize switching time. During your presentation, a
  volunteer will be sitting next to the podium to assist with AV difficulties
  and to provide time cues for you.
