---

**Abstract:**

DevOps is an extension of agile thinking. It is not a fad. It is a culture! As long as the agile based methodologies are hot topics, DevOps culture will be our concern, too. So, if DevOps is not a one size fits all, then we should start to change our management skills according to new game rules. In this session, the way of project management in DevOps will be presented.
